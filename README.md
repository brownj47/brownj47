### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Full Stack Developer
Passionate Software Engineer with a background in biology/healthcare and a love for creative problem-solving. ðŸš€

Driven by the endless possibilities of technology, I transitioned from a career as a healthcare professional to pursue Software Development. I find joy in brainstorming and cherish the process of turning ideas into impactful solutions.

I am interested in roles that allow me to combine my technical prowess with my background in healthcare, biology, and research to bring a unique perspective to every project. 

I'm deeply passionate about continual learning and I do my best work when I know I am making meaningful contributions to my team and the product. I strive to write clean, maintainable and efficient code to provide a seamless UX/DX.
